Exploration of TP53 Gene Mutations in Breast Tumor Cells. Evaluating Their Influence on the Diversity of Breast Cancer Types Through Bioinformatic Analysis with RStudio.

This study analyzed the mutated TP53 gene in breast cancer of the Invasive Ductal Carcinoma and Invasive Lobular Carcinoma types, to understand whether certain types of mutations predominate according to the cancer type and how the molecular profiles of tumor cells relate to them. These analyses could provide information for the diagnosis and personalized treatment of breast cancer.
